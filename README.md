##React-Redux-Sails Prototype

This prototype application was written in server side with 
 sails and in client side as I as asked with React, Redux and React-toolbox. 
 Therefore, I have decided to do them completely separate. There maybe exist better 
 idea however, I will stick on my decision. 
 
 1- Please to setup and run application in for Client side please follow to the client folder and read instruction. 
  
 2- Please to setup and run application in for Server side please follow to the Server folder and read instruction. 

If you have any question feel free to email me or open an issue.
